# Fresh-Install-Script
A batch and a python script that manages to download programs on a fresh windows system.
It also prevents Windows Update from making automatic downloads such as video card drivers by stopping Windows Update Service and changing your windows power plan.

Make sure to run install_all.bat in admin mode.

# Selecting the desired programs
The desired programs to be downloaded and installed can be selected by changing the chocolatey command line located at install_all.bat
I also recommend you to also check Chocolatey's page and documentation before editing it. It's worth it :)
